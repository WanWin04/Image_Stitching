# Project Structure
The organizational structure of our project is as follows:

**"data" Folder:**

* Contains the original raw UDIS-D dataset. Because the capacity is too large, I only push a very small part. Please download the full data set at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kC7KAULd5mZsqaWnY3-rSbQLaZ7LujTY

**"doc" Folder:**

* Holds documentation and scientific papers that we referenced and used in this project.

**"src" Folder:**

* Includes two subfolders, storing the source code for traditional (non-deep learning) methods and deep learning methods. Please read README.md for more details.
